# Scheduler

This pakage contains two python programs that executes the same scheduler in two different forms. The main_standalone.py executes the aplication on the console (local). The Flask.py executes the application in the console as a service, this permits a user connect to this server and execute the scheduler (remmote).

Moreover, I provide a manual which shows how the scheduler has to be run (user manual), and TFM_final.pdf where it is explained how the scheduler works internally( note that is the final report on my master thesis).

Enjoy :)
